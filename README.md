# Adjusted Version (Python3)
The command to run PNN_testing.py with gpu is:
```
THEANO_FLAGS=device=cuda0 python3 PNN_testing.py -g True
```


# pansharpening-cnn
[Target-adaptive CNN-based pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06054) is an advanced version of pansharpening method [PNN](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/7/594) with residual learning, different loss and a target-adaptive phase.

# Prerequisits
This code is written for Python2.7 and uses Theano library.
The list of all requirements is in `requirements.txt`.

The command to install the requirements is: 

```
cat requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 -L 1 pip2 install
```

Optional requirements for using gpu:
* cuda = 8 
* cudnn = 5

# Usage
* set all paramaters in `config_testing_<SENSOR>.xml`:
	* sensor:	GeoEye1, IKONOS, WV2
	* mode:		`full` to high resolution pansharpening (PAN scale); `reduce` to low resolution pansharening (MS scale).
	* fine tuning:	set epochs `0` to not fine tune; set epochs `n` to do n epochs of fine tuning.
	* paths:	path of pretrained network; path of image to test; path of output image; path of fine tuned network.

* run test without gpu:

```	
python PNN_testing.py -s <SENSOR>
```

* run test with gpu:

```
PATH=<CUDAPATH>:$PATH python PNN_testing.py -g -s <SENSOR>
```

* Output:
	* result: `./outputs/<SENSOR>/output.mat`;
	* (eventual) fine-tuned network: `./outputs/<SENSOR>/FT_network/PNN_model.mat`.
	

Where `<SENSOR>` can be: 'GE1','IK','WV2'; 
and `<CUDAPATH>` is your bin local path of cuda.
